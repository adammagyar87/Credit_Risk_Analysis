# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Our assignment was to use machine learning models via python to review credit applications and determine risk. We did the following:

- Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

## Deliverable 1: 

We created and compared three machine learning models. We used two oversampling algorithms, RandomOverSampler and SMOTE. We then used an undersampling algorithms, ClusterCentroids. The results for each are found below:

###  RandomOverSampler

## Deliverable 2:

We utilized the SMOTEENN algorithm which is a combination of both over and undersampling as another comparison. The results from this model are seen below:

## Deliverable 3: 

We compared two ensemble algorithms to determine which would result in the best performance. The two models used were a Balanced Random Forest Classifier and an Easy Ensemble AdaBoost classifier. The results are seen below:

### Deliverable 4: Summary

Looking at the results, we see that
